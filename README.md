# Knowledge Check 2 - Bootstrap HTML Project

## About This Project
This is my project for the Knowledge Check 2 assignment at Coding Temple.  
I built a basic website using **Bootstrap 5** that shows a registration form, a table with user info, some images, and a navigation bar. The page is responsive and should work on all screen sizes.

## What I Made

- **Navbar**  
  - A simple navigation bar with links to Home, About, and Contact.
  - It turns into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.

- **Registration Form**  
  - A form with First Name, Last Name, Email, Password, and a checkbox for agreeing to terms.
  - The First and Last Name fields are side-by-side.
  - The Email and Password fields have validation so you can't leave them empty.
  - The submit button is green using Bootstrap's `btn-success` class.

- **User Table**  
  - A table that shows some hard-coded user data.
  - It has striped rows and highlights when you hover over it.
  - Itâ€™s wrapped in a `table-responsive` div so it looks good on small screens.

- **Images and Buttons**  
  - A big image across the page using `img-fluid`.
  - A smaller round image underneath.
  - Two buttons:  
    - One shows on all screen sizes.  
    - The other is hidden on small screens (using `d-none d-md-block`).

- **Responsive Layout**  
  - I used Bootstrap containers to make sure the layout adjusts nicely on different devices.
